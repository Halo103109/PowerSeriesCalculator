This repo is intended to be viewing only.

The project is still under development and await for more testing.


ABOUT THE PROJECT:
-
This is a mathematical tool designed to solve ordinary differential equations, especially for those regular-singular points.

The mathematical algorithms are provided by Professor Mohammad Niksirat.

The PowerSeriesCalculator class takes two arguments as input: Px and Qx, which corresponds to the terms in this general formula: x^2 * y'' + Px * y' + Qx * y = 0. It outputs the first solution y1(x) and the second solution y2(x) in the form of power series, and two graphs with adjustable domains.


ABOUT CURRENT VERSION:
-

- Able to handle Cauchy Euler Case.
- Able to calculate Regular-Singular points using the recursive formula of Cn.
- Able to calculate Regular-Singular points using the normal approach. (except the s1-s2=0 case)
