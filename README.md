ABOUT THE PROJECT:
-
This is a mathematical tool designed to solve power series equations in ODE, especially for regular-singular points.
It takes two arguments as input

ABOUT CURRENT VERSION:
-

- Able to handle all the Cauchy Euler Case.
- Able to calculate polynomial terms 
- Methods using recursive formula work on Regular-Singular points and will output the correct result.
- Methods using
